#JAS
The code here is specific to ispider.smith.man.ac.uk and the code currently only runs on the cluster and the different analysis are farmed off to the nodes of the cluster.  there are 2 different directories where the output files are stored ad this could be merged into 1.  The reason for 2 is that any files not required to be viewed directly can be sent to the /var/www/tmp/ dir however the images (pngs) and the peptide lists that are created need to be on the webserver so they can be viewed hence they are stored in /var/www/localhost/htdocs/FDRanalysis/tmp/

Also to get this to work paths need to be changed for the perl_modules and the FDRscore work

FDRanalysis.pl  

This script contains most of the web results.  It farms of the other perlscript to the nodes and that does all the work.  this script will check for results and will either produce a waiting page or display the results.

TestMascotAllDecoySearchesInOne.pl

This will do all the analysis and produce the apropriate results ... the main workhorse of the operation!
